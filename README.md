# Single-stage Detector
This detector determines the smallest possible bounding box where the taillights and brake lights of the vehicles are located

# Dataset
* Collecting Large-scale dataset from the rear view of vehicles along with labeling Region of Interest (ROIs) of taillights and brake lights
* Supporting two types of Dash-cam ang Insta-360 Camerras
* Including four classes: a) running  b) braking c) left turn  d) right turn
